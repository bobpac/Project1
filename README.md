# CONCENTRATION
I used to love watching the classic game show of Concentration on TV as a kid. The show was on and off the air a total of 24 years with the last game show host being the late, great Alex Trebek.

## Rules

1. Game consists of a single player.
2. A player's turn includes clicking the mouse over two squares to reveal an emoji hiding underneath. If the player does not find a matching set of emojies, the number of the square is put back.
3. Player must find all 15 matching pairs of emojis within the maximum number of guesses to win the game.

### Playing a Game
As you progress in the game, you'll gradually accumulate pairs of images making the game easier and easier.

### Winning the Game
If you uncover all 15 pairs of emoji's, you win! But if you at first don't succeed, try, try, again.

## Next Steps

Version 2.0 of the game could include:

1. Total number of games won and lost.
2. Support of the rebus puzzle (similar to how the TV show had).
3. Sound effects (like a TV game show), e.g. applause, theme music.
